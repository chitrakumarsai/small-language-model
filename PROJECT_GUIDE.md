## Dataset Preparation
The dataset used for training the small language model is prepared by collecting and cleaning raw text data. The data is then split into training, validation, and test sets. Proper preprocessing steps such as normalization, lowercasing, and removal of unwanted characters are applied to ensure data quality. The dataset is stored in a format compatible with the tokenization process.

## Tokenization
Tokenization is performed using a byte pair encoding (BPE) or similar subword tokenization technique to convert raw text into tokens that the model can process. The tokenizer is trained on the dataset to build a vocabulary of tokens. Tokenization scripts handle converting text data into sequences of token IDs and vice versa.

## Model Architecture Overview
The model is based on a transformer architecture tailored for language modeling tasks. It consists of multiple transformer blocks with self-attention mechanisms, feed-forward layers, and layer normalization. The model uses embeddings to represent tokens and positional encodings to capture token positions in sequences.

## Training Process
Training is conducted using mini-batch gradient descent with the Adam optimizer or a variant. The training loop includes forward passes, loss computation using cross-entropy, backpropagation, and parameter updates. Learning rate scheduling and gradient clipping are applied to stabilize training. Training progress is monitored using validation loss and accuracy metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, and loss on validation and test datasets. Perplexity measures how well the model predicts a sample and is a common metric for language models. These metrics guide hyperparameter tuning and model improvements.

## Checkpointing
During training, model checkpoints are saved periodically to enable resuming training or evaluation from intermediate states. Checkpoints include model weights, optimizer states, and training metadata. This ensures training progress is not lost due to interruptions.

## Export Formats
After training, the model can be exported in various formats such as PyTorch `.pt` files or ONNX for interoperability. Exporting facilitates model deployment and inference in different environments.

## Inference with Generation
The model supports text generation by sampling or greedy decoding from the learned probability distributions over tokens. Inference scripts load the trained model and tokenizer to generate coherent text sequences given a prompt. Various decoding strategies like temperature sampling and top-k/top-p sampling are implemented to control generation diversity.

## Major Scripts and Their Responsibilities
- `prepare_data.py`: Handles dataset collection, cleaning, and splitting.  
- `tokenizer_train.py`: Trains the tokenizer on the dataset and builds vocabulary.  
- `train.py`: Contains the training loop, loss computation, and checkpointing.  
- `evaluate.py`: Evaluates the model on validation and test sets using defined metrics.  
- `export_model.py`: Exports the trained model to desired formats for deployment.  
- `generate.py`: Performs inference and text generation using the trained model.  

## Summary Note
This project guide outlines the key components and workflow for developing a small language model. Following this structured approach ensures reproducibility and clarity in the model development lifecycle. Proper dataset preparation, model design, training, evaluation, and deployment steps are critical for building effective language models.
